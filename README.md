### This is my live portfolio for the projects that I have done so far. I will continue to post new projects on here to showcase more of my skills and what I have learned. I am a new beginner, but everyone has to start somewhere. I am continuing to grow my skills so that I can change the trajectory of my career. San Antonio has it's tech bubble, but I want to make that bigger.

### I have a dream of starting my own tech foundation to partner with women and children shelters and help carve a new life for them.

### I am a woman who LOVES her video games and anime. Come chat me up one day about either of them.

### You can see my portfolio live at https://www.shauricepearson.com/

### I do eventually want to learn other languages and finally go back to school to obtain my degree, but I felt the courage to take a leap of faith.

### I do hope we get to talk sometime. Maybe over coffee!! I love a good slow-pour!!
